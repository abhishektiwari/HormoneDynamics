Hormone Dynamics!
=================

This web portal is an open notebook for my dissertation project, Modelling Hormone Dynamics - Biophysical Modelling of the ACTH-induced Steroidogenesis. I am currently a third year doctoral student in Bioengineering at the University of Auckland. My area of research is modelling of hormone dynamics, and much of my research is focused on the systems biology based approach to understand physiological mechanisms responsible for the hormonal pulsatility. 


Why an Open Notebook?
---------------------

I am very much inspired from the idea that as scientists (at least in academia) we have a moral obligation to conduct and report our science in a transparent manner. Practices such as publishing your research in an open access journal, releasing data or model in a standard format and maintaining a open notebook can improve the communication of science. Unlike a typical `Open Notebook Science <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Notebook_Science/>`_  project where updates are available to the public in as close to real time as possible, this notebook follows a delayed and selected content approach.



Work in progress
----------------
This project is still under progress and it seems like it would take longer than I expected before. Keep an eye on this space for new informative contents. If you have any questions about content please drop me an email at abhishek@abhishek-tiwari.com.
